# Markdown Previewer

The Markdown Previewer project is another beginner-friendly project often found in freeCodeCamp's front-end curriculum. The main objective of this project is to create a web-based application that allows users to input Markdown syntax and see a live preview of the formatted content.

## Features:

- **Input Markdown**: Users should be able to input Markdown syntax into a text area.
- **Live Preview**: As users type Markdown, the application should display a live preview of the formatted content.
- **Styling and Design**: The application should have a clean and user-friendly interface. CSS is typically used to style both the input and preview areas.
- **Markdown Support**: The previewer should support a variety of Markdown features like headers, lists, links, and emphasis.

## Technologies Used:

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- React

This project is a great way for beginners to practice handling user input, updating the DOM dynamically, and working with text formatting and parsing.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
