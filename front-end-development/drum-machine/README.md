# Drum Machine

The Drum Machine project is a beginner-friendly front-end project commonly included in freeCodeCamp's curriculum. The objective of this project is to create a virtual drum machine that allows users to play various drum sounds by clicking on buttons or using keyboard keys.

## Features:

- **Interactive Drum Sounds**: Users should be able to trigger drum sounds by clicking on buttons representing different drum pads or by pressing corresponding keys on the keyboard.

- **Visual Feedback**: When a drum pad is triggered, there should be visual feedback to indicate which sound is being played.

- **Styling and Design**: The drum machine should have an appealing and intuitive user interface, often designed using CSS to resemble a physical drum machine.

- **Customizable**: Some implementations allow users to customize the sounds or layout of the drum machine.

## Technologies Used:

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Audio API (for playing sounds)
- React

This project is a fun way for beginners to practice handling user input events, playing audio files programmatically, and creating interactive web applications.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
